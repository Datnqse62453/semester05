## Selecting and implementing a requirement tool
### Selecting a tool
Based on desired features, platorm and pricing.
#### Process for selecting:
1. Identify requirements for the tool
2. Prioritize and weight them
3. Set up demos of tools
4. Score each tool on criterias
5. Calculate total score of each tool
6. Choose best tools, use them on actual project
7. To make a final selection, combine scores, costs.

#### Seting up the tool and process
1. Install a tool
2. Load a project's requirements into it
3. Define attributes and trace links
4. Keep the contents current
5. Define access groups and privileges
6. Adapt the process

#### Facilitating user adoption
Make people fall in love with the tools
